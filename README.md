# Dynamic Programming Tabulation "Fibonacci Sequence"

The function ‘fib(num)‘ that takes in a number as arguments.

* The function returns the n-th number of the Fibonacci Sequence.
* The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1.
* To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two.

num | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
fib(num) | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34

# Complexity

Assume that:
n = number

Time Complexity is O(n)
Space Complexity is O(n)
